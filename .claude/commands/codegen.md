We are in the process of building the project described in docs/tech-spec.md.
We are doing this by going through the steps described in docs/implementation-plan.md.

## Instructions

For the next unchecked step in docs/implementation-plan.md, follow the explore→plan→code framework to ensure a systematic and thorough implementation approach:

### 1. EXPLORE Phase
- Use search tools to understand the codebase structure  
- Think deeply about what context you need to gather to get you fully prepared to start working on the task.
- Read relevant files to understand existing patterns and conventions, including but not limited to the Suggested Files for Context included in the step.
- Identify dependencies, libraries, and frameworks being used  
- Note any existing similar implementations or patterns
- For external documentation, use the Context7 MCP server to access the latest documentation 
- Document key findings that will inform your implementation

### 2. PLAN Phase
- Use TodoWrite to create a detailed task list  
- Break down the complex task into smaller, manageable steps  
- Identify potential challenges or dependencies  
- Determine the order of implementation  
- Consider edge cases and error handling  
- Plan for testing and validation 
- PLEASE: Ask any clarifying questions you need to deliver the best possible version of the task.
- Explain your plan (including an overview of the relevant programming concepts) for a beginner so they can understand what your code will be doing and are able to evaluate the implementation of the step.
- Go back and forth with me until we have a clear, complete understanding of the task and the plan.
- Do not write code until we have a complete plan and I approve the plan. Once I approve the plan, move on to the CODE Phase.


### 3. CODE Phase
- Work through your todo list systematically    
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns discovered during exploration    
- Verify the solution works as expected. If backend-related, run a quick terminal test.
- Mark task as completed after verification & note decisions/bugs in @implementationplan.md
- Do not proceed to work on the next step, I will want to verify the implementation of the existing step first.

**Remember:**  
- Be thorough in exploration before planning  
- Create specific, actionable todo items  
- Follow existing patterns and conventions  
- Test and validate your implementation  
- Keep the user informed of your progress  
- You also have permission to modify and update the implementation plan if needed.
