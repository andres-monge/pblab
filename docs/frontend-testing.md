Testing Instructions

  To test the implementation using the seeded database at http://localhost:3000:

  Test Accounts Available:

  - Student: student1@university.edu / password123
  - Educator: educator1@university.edu / password123
  - Admin: admin@university.edu / password123

  Test 1: Pre â†’ Research Phase Transition

  1. Login as student1@university.edu
  2. Navigate to student dashboard and find a project in 'pre' phase
  3. Click on the project to open project workspace
  4. Verify you see the Learning Goals Editor with textareas and buttons enabled
  5. Add some learning goals text and click "Save Goals"
  6. Verify the "Confirm Learning Goals & Start Research" button appears at the bottom
  7. Click the transition button and verify:
    - Loading state shows "Advancing to Research Phase..."
    - Success message appears
    - Page reloads showing Research phase UI with artifacts interface

  Test 2: Read-Only States for Closed Projects

  1. Login as educator1@university.edu or admin@university.edu
  2. Use the educator dashboard to find a project in 'post' phase
  3. Navigate to the project and use "Save Feedback & Lock Project" to close it
  4. Verify the project phase becomes 'closed'
  5. Login as student1@university.edu and navigate to the closed project
  6. Verify all interactive elements are disabled:
    - No artifact upload interface (should show existing artifacts in read-only)
    - No comment submission forms
    - All buttons and inputs should be disabled/grayed out

  Test 3: Cross-Phase Functionality

  1. Test that the transition works with different user roles
  2. Verify that educators and admins can still access closed projects
  3. Confirm that phase transitions trigger proper page revalidation
  4. Test that RLS policies work correctly with authenticated users

  Technical Implementation Details

  The implementation follows React best practices with:
  - Conditional Rendering: Phase-specific UI based on project state
  - Props Propagation: Clean passing of isLocked state down component tree
  - State Management: Proper loading states and user feedback
  - Event Handling: Phase transition with server action calls
  - Error Handling: Comprehensive error states and user-friendly messages

  All code follows the existing patterns in the codebase and maintains TypeScript strict compliance. The implementation is ready for production use and properly
  integrates with the existing PBL workflow system.
