Step 28.1 Complete Problem-to-Project Workflow Testing at localhost:3000

**Testing PRD Requirements**: This test verifies the end-to-end workflow from educator problem creation with team assignment to student project access, addressing PRD User Stories 3.1.1 (student can join team) and 3.2.1 (educator can create PBL problem).

Prerequisites Check

1. âœ… Ensure npm run dev is running at localhost:3000
2. âœ… Confirm database is seeded: `npm run db:seed -- --force`
3. âœ… Verify local Supabase is running: `supabase status`

**Success Criteria Checklist** (PRD Requirements)

**Educator Workflow (PRD 3.2.1):**
- âœ… Can create PBL problem with title, description, and rubric
- âœ… Can create teams during problem creation
- âœ… Can assign students to teams via simple interface
- âœ… Teams and projects auto-created in single transaction

**Student Workflow (PRD 3.1.1):**
- âœ… Students automatically have access to projects
- âœ… Can join team (implicit via educator assignment)
- âœ… Can access project workspace immediately
- âœ… See correct team assignments

**Technical Requirements:**
- âœ… No manual admin intervention required
- âœ… End-to-end workflow from problem â†’ teams â†’ projects
- âœ… RLS policies working correctly
- âœ… Database transactions maintain consistency

**Critical Gap Resolved:**
- âœ… Educators can now create problems AND make them accessible to students
- âœ… Students immediately see projects after educator creates them
- âœ… Complete workflow eliminates broken user experience

If Any Issues Found

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all 4 students are visible in team creation
- Confirm project appears on both students' dashboards
- Ensure no database constraint violations

**Expected Result**: Complete end-to-end workflow from educator problem creation to student project access works seamlessly! ðŸŽ‰
